<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a Sophomore pursuing an Associates Degree in Computer Science at Suffolk County
   Community College. I plan to also continue my education at Stony Brook University where I will 
   obtain a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. </p>

<p>Throughout my coursework at Suffolk, I have gained a solid foundation in key concepts of Computer Science,
     including data structures, algorithms,  and software engineering. I have also had extensive  experience in 
     programming languages such as Java and JavaFX. In particular, I recently worked on a Capstone Project where 
     we developed an application that integrated a MVC framework to allow administrators of colleges to assign 
     professors to different sections based on their seniority and preferred times to teach. This experience enhanced 
     my understanding of back-end  development and taught me the importance of writing clean, maintainable code while 
     organizing a framework to organize material. </p>

<p>In addition to my project, I have been actively involved in an online course to teach myself Full-Stack Web 
      Development. This experience has taught me new languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as other 
      things such as PostgreSQL. I am eager to apply these skills in an internship environment and learn from experienced
       professionals.</p>
